# DES Cryptanalysis attack example

These are examples of DES attacks.

### Setup and running
It isn't required, but this project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the sake of organization. If you're familiar with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), I suggest you run this project with it. Otherwise, use `Python 3.12` (other versions are likely fine as well). The only required package is [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/).
